 Q1. What is a time series, and what are some common applications of time series analysis?
- A time series is a sequence of data points collected or recorded over time, typically at equally spaced intervals. 
Time series analysis involves studying patterns, trends, and behaviors within the data. Common applications include stock price prediction, 
weather forecasting, sales forecasting, and economic trend analysis.

Q2. What are some common time series patterns, and how can they be identified and interpreted?
- Common patterns include trend, seasonality, and cyclicality. Trends indicate a long-term movement in data, seasonality 
reflects recurring patterns, and cyclicality involves repetitive but non-fixed cycles. Patterns can be identified using 
visualization techniques, such as plotting the data or decomposing it into trend and seasonality components.

Q3. How can time series data be preprocessed before applying analysis techniques?
- Time series data preprocessing involves handling missing values, handling outliers, and ensuring the data is at a
consistent frequency. Techniques include imputation for missing values, outlier detection and removal, and resampling 
to ensure uniform intervals. This ensures the data is ready for analysis.

python
# Example: Handling missing values in time series data using pandas
df['column_name'].fillna(method='ffill', inplace=True)

Q4. How can time series forecasting be used in business decision-making, and what are some common challenges and limitations?
- Time series forecasting aids businesses in predicting future trends, optimizing inventory, and making informed decisions. 
Challenges include dealing with noisy data, capturing complex patterns, and adapting to sudden changes. Limitations involve 
uncertainties and the assumption that historical patterns will continue.

Q5. What is ARIMA modelling, and how can it be used to forecast time series data?
- ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) is a popular time series forecasting method that combines autoregression,
differencing, and moving averages. It models the relationship between an observation and its lagged values. ARIMA is effective 
for stationary time series data and can be used for short to medium-term forecasting.

python
# Example: Using ARIMA in Python with statsmodels
from statsmodels.tsa.arima.model import ARIMA
model = ARIMA(data, order=(p, d, q))
result = model.fit()

Q6. How do Autocorrelation Function (ACF) and Partial Autocorrelation Function (PACF) plots help in identifying the order of ARIMA models?
- ACF and PACF plots show the correlation between a time series and its lagged values. Peaks in the ACF plot indicate the order 
of the moving average (MA) component, while PACF plot peaks indicate the autoregressive (AR) component order. 
These plots help determine the p, d, and q parameters for ARIMA models.

python
# Example: Plotting ACF and PACF using statsmodels
from statsmodels.graphics.tsaplots import plot_acf, plot_pacf
plot_acf(data)
plot_pacf(data)

Q7. What are the assumptions of ARIMA models, and how can they be tested for in practice?
- ARIMA assumes stationarity, meaning mean and variance are constant over time. This can be tested using statistical tests 
like the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test. Additionally, the residuals of the model should be independent and normally distributed.

python
# Example: Conducting Augmented Dickey-Fuller test using statsmodels
from statsmodels.tsa.stattools import adfuller
result = adfuller(data)

Q8. Suppose you have monthly sales data for a retail store for the past three years. Which type of time series model would 

you recommend for forecasting future sales, and why?
- The choice depends on the characteristics of the data. If there's a clear trend and seasonality, ARIMA may be suitable. 
If the data exhibits non-linear patterns, machine learning models like LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) or Prophet could be considered.
Proper analysis and testing, including evaluating different models, are essential.

Q9. What are some of the limitations of time series analysis? Provide an example of a scenario where the limitations of time series 
analysis may be particularly relevant.
- Time series analysis assumes that future patterns will resemble past patterns, making it challenging in scenarios with sudden, 
unforeseen changes. For example, during a global pandemic, consumer behavior and sales patterns may deviate significantly from 
historical trends, limiting the accuracy of time series forecasts.

Q10. Explain the difference between a stationary and non-stationary time series. How does the stationarity of a time series affect the choice of forecasting model?
- A stationary time series has constant mean and variance over time, while a non-stationary series exhibits trends or seasonality. Stationarity is crucial for ARIMA models, which assume a stable statistical structure. Non-stationary series may require differencing to achieve stationarity before applying ARIMA, emphasizing the importance of understanding and transforming the data appropriately.
