Q1. What is the difference between Ordinal Encoding and Label Encoding? Provide an example of when you
might choose one over the other.
Ans:
    Ordinal Encoding: It's used for categorical variables with a clear ordering or hierarchy. Each category is assigned an integer 
    value according to its order.
    Label Encoding: It's used for categorical variables without a particular order. Each category is assigned a unique integer value.
    Example:
    
    Ordinal Encoding: Education level (Low, Medium, High) where Low=1, Medium=2, High=3.
    Label Encoding: Colors (Red, Green, Blue) where Red=0, Green=1, Blue=2.
    we might choose ordinal encoding when there's a meaningful order, and label encoding when there's no inherent order

Q2. Explain how Target Guided Ordinal Encoding works and provide an example of when you might use it in
a machine learning project.
Ans:
    This technique maps categories to ordinal values based on the mean of the target variable for each category. 
    It captures the relationship between categorical variables and the target.
    
    Example:
    In a loan default prediction model, you can encode "Income Source" using target guided ordinal encoding. 
    High-risk income sources might get higher ordinal values if they have a higher likelihood of default

Q3. Define covariance and explain why it is important in statistical analysis. How is covariance calculated?
Ans:
The formula for covariance is given by:

\[ \text{cov}(X, Y) = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \bar{x})(y_i - \bar{y}) \]

Where:
- \( X \) and \( Y \) are the two random variables.
- \( n \) is the number of data points.
- \( x_i \) and \( y_i \) are the individual data points for \( X \) and \( Y \) respectively.
- \( \bar{x} \) and \( \bar{y} \) are the means of \( X \) and \( Y \) respectively.

Q4. For a dataset with the following categorical variables: Color (red, green, blue), Size (small, medium,
large), and Material (wood, metal, plastic), perform label encoding using Python's scikit-learn library.

Q5. Calculate the covariance matrix for the following variables in a dataset: Age, Income, and Education
level. Interpret the results.

Q6. You are working on a machine learning project with a dataset containing several categorical
variables, including "Gender" (Male/Female), "Education Level" (High School/Bachelor's/Master's/PhD),
and "Employment Status" (Unemployed/Part-Time/Full-Time). Which encoding method would you use for
each variable, and why?
Ans:
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Q7. You are analyzing a dataset with two continuous variables, "Temperature" and "Humidity", and two
categorical variables, "Weather Condition" (Sunny/Cloudy/Rainy) and "Wind Direction" (North/South/
East/West). Calculate the covariance between each pair of variables and interpret the results.
