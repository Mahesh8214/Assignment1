Q1. What is hierarchical clustering, and how is it different from other clustering techniques?
- Answer:
  - Hierarchical clustering is a method that creates a tree of clusters, either by merging or splitting them.
  - It differs from other techniques in that it forms a hierarchy of clusters, allowing for exploration at different granularity levels.

Q2. What are the two main types of hierarchical clustering algorithms? Describe each in brief.
- Answer:
  - Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering: Starts with individual data points as clusters and merges them iteratively based on similarity.
  - Divisive Hierarchical Clustering: Starts with all data points in one cluster and splits them based on dissimilarity.

Q3. How do you determine the distance between two clusters in hierarchical clustering, and what are the common distance metrics used?
- Answer:
  - Distance can be measured using various metrics such as Euclidean distance, Manhattan distance, or cosine similarity.
  - Common distance metrics include:
    - Euclidean Distance
    - Manhattan Distance
    - Cosine Similarity
    - Jaccard Distance

Q4. How do you determine the optimal number of clusters in hierarchical clustering, and what are some common methods used for this purpose?
- Answer:
  - Methods include:
    - Visual Inspection of Dendrogram: Identify the level at which the tree has the best balance.
    - Gap Statistics: Compare clustering performance to a random distribution.
    - Silhouette Score: Evaluate how well-separated clusters are.
    - Cophenetic Correlation Coefficient: Measure how faithfully a dendrogram preserves pairwise distances.

Q5. What are dendrograms in hierarchical clustering, and how are they useful in analyzing the results?
- Answer:
  - Dendrograms are tree diagrams illustrating the arrangement of clusters.
  - Useful in analyzing results by visually identifying clusters, their relationships, and the optimal number of clusters.

Q6. Can hierarchical clustering be used for both numerical and categorical data? If yes, how are the distance metrics different for each type of data?
- Answer:
  - Yes, hierarchical clustering can handle both types of data.
  - For numerical data, distance metrics like Euclidean or Manhattan are common.
  - For categorical data, methods like Gower's distance or Jaccard distance are more appropriate.

Q7. How can you use hierarchical clustering to identify outliers or anomalies in your data?
- Answer:
  - Outliers can be identified as individual data points or small clusters separated from the main hierarchy.
  - Examining branches with a small number of data points or large distances may reveal potential outliers.
