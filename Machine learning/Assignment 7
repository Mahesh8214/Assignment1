Q1. Pearson correlation coefficient is a measure of the linear relationship between two variables. Suppose
you have collected data on the amount of time students spend studying for an exam and their final exam
scores. Calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient between these two variables and interpret the result.
Ans:
    Assuming you have study time and exam scores data, you can calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient using the following steps:
    
    Calculate the mean (average) of both study time and exam scores.
    Calculate the deviations of each data point from the mean for both variables.
    Calculate the product of the deviations for each pair of data points.
    Sum up the products of deviations.
    Divide the sum by the product of the standard deviations of both variables.
    Interpretation:
    The Pearson correlation coefficient ranges from -1 to 1. A positive value indicates a positive linear relationship between study time 
    and exam scores, where higher study time tends to correspond with higher exam scores. A negative value indicates a negative linear
    relationship. A value close to 0 suggests a weak or no linear relationship between the two variables.

    import numpy as np
    
    np.random.seed(0)
    
    study_time = np.random.randint(1, 10, 50)  # Random study time values
    exam_scores = np.random.randint(50, 100, 50)  # Random exam score values
    
    correlation_coefficient = np.corrcoef(study_time, exam_scores)[0, 1]
    print("Pearson Correlation Coefficient:", correlation_coefficient)

Q2. Spearman's rank correlation is a measure of the monotonic relationship between two variables.
Suppose you have collected data on the amount of sleep individuals get each night and their overall job
satisfaction level on a scale of 1 to 10. Calculate the Spearman's rank correlation between these two
variables and interpret the result.
Ans:
    Spearman's rank correlation involves ranking the data and then calculating the Pearson correlation coefficient for the ranks.
    A positive value suggests a monotonic increase in job satisfaction with increased sleep, and a negative value suggests the opposite.
    A value close to 0 indicates a weak or no monotonic relationship.

Q3. Suppose you are conducting a study to examine the relationship between the number of hours of
exercise per week and body mass index (BMI) in a sample of adults. You collected data on both variables
for 50 participants. Calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient and the Spearman's rank correlation
between these two variables and compare the results.
Ans:

Q4. A researcher is interested in examining the relationship between the number of hours individuals
spend watching television per day and their level of physical activity. The researcher collected data on
both variables from a sample of 50 participants. Calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient between
these two variables.
Ans:
     tv_hours = np.random.randint(1, 5, 50)  # Random TV watching hours
    physical_activity = np.random.randint(1, 10, 50)  # Random physical activity levels
    
    correlation_coefficient = np.corrcoef(tv_hours, physical_activity)[0, 1]
    print("Pearson Correlation Coefficient:", correlation_coefficient)

Q5. A survey was conducted to examine the relationship between age and preference for a particular
brand of soft drink. The survey results are shown below:
Ans:
    import pandas as pd
    
    data = {
        'Age': [25, 42, 37, 19, 31, 28],
        'Soft_Drink_Preference': ['Coke', 'Pepsi', 'Mountain dew', 'Coke', 'Pepsi', 'Coke']
    }
    
    df = pd.DataFrame(data)
    
    contingency_table = pd.crosstab(df['Age'], df['Soft_Drink_Preference'])
    print(contingency_table)

Q6. A company is interested in examining the relationship between the number of sales calls made per day
and the number of sales made per week. The company collected data on both variables from a sample of
30 sales representatives. Calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient between these two variables.
Ans:
   
   correlation_coefficient = np.corrcoef(sales_calls, sales)[0, 1]
   print("Pearson Correlation Coefficient:", correlation_coefficient)
