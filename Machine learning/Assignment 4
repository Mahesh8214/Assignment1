**Q1. What is Min-Max scaling, and how is it used in data preprocessing? Provide an example to illustrate its application.**

Ans:
    Min-Max scaling is a data preprocessing technique used to scale and transform numerical features to a specific range, usually between 0 and 1.
    It's done by subtracting the minimum value of the feature and then dividing by the range (difference between the maximum and minimum values).
    This technique is useful when features have different scales, and you want to bring them to a common scale for machine learning
    algorithms that are sensitive to feature scales, such as gradient descent-based algorithms.

Example:
    Suppose you have a feature "age" in a dataset with values ranging from 20 to 80. Applying Min-Max scaling would transform
    these values to a range between 0 and 1 based on the formula:
    
    Scaled Value = (Value - Min) / (Max - Min)

**Q2. What is the Unit Vector technique in feature scaling, and how does it differ from Min-Max scaling?
Provide an example to illustrate its application.**

Ans:
    The Unit Vector technique, also known as normalization, scales features to have a unit norm (length of 1) along their axis. 
    It's used to ensure that the feature vector has the same scale regardless of its original range. 
    This is particularly useful in cases where the direction of the data matters more than the actual values.

Example:
    Consider a dataset with two features: "height" and "weight." To normalize these features, you would calculate
    the length of the feature vector and then divide each feature by that length, effectively projecting the data onto a unit vector.

**Q3. What is PCA (Principle Component Analysis), and how is it used in dimensionality reduction? 
Provide an example to illustrate its application.**

Ans:
    Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a dimensionality reduction technique that aims to transform high-dimensional
    data into a lower-dimensional space while preserving as much of the original variance as possible. It does this by finding
    orthogonal axes (principal components) along which the data varies the most.
    
    Example:
    Let's say you have a dataset with many correlated features representing different aspects of the same data. 
    By applying PCA, you can find new orthogonal axes that capture the maximum variance. You can then choose to 
    keep a certain number of principal components, effectively reducing the dimensionality of your data while retaining the most important information.

**Q4. What is the relationship between PCA and Feature Extraction, and how can PCA be used for Feature Extraction?
Provide an example to illustrate this concept.**

Ans:
    PCA can be used for feature extraction by transforming the original features into a new set of features represented 
    by the principal components. These principal components are linear combinations of the original features that capture 
    the most variance in the data.

Example:
    In image processing, you can use PCA to extract features from images. Suppose you have a dataset of images, and each 
    pixel is a feature. Applying PCA to these images will give you principal components that represent patterns of pixel variations
    across the dataset. These components can be considered as new features that capture the essence of the original images in a 
    lower-dimensional space.

**Q5. You are working on a project to build a recommendation system for a food delivery service. The dataset contains 
features such as price, rating, and delivery time. Explain how you would use Min-Max scaling to preprocess the data.**

Ans:
    For the recommendation system project, we would apply Min-Max scaling to the features like price, rating, and delivery time. 
    This is to ensure that these features are on the same scale and don't dominate each other based on their original ranges.
    By scaling them to a common range, we create a level playing field for the recommendation algorithm to consider all 
    features equally when making recommendations.

**Q6. You are working on a project to build a model to predict stock prices. The dataset contains many features, such 
as company financial data and market trends. Explain how you would use PCA to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset.**

Ans:
    In the stock price prediction project, you would use PCA to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset. First, you would gather
    all the relevant features, which could be numerous. Then, you would apply PCA to these features to identify the principal
    components that capture the most significant variability in the data. You can choose to retain a certain number of these 
    principal components, effectively reducing the dimensionality of the dataset while maintaining the most critical information 
    for prediction.

**Q7. For a dataset containing the following values: [1, 5, 10, 15, 201], perform Min-Max scaling to transform the
values to a range of -1 to 1.**

Ans:
    To perform Min-Max scaling and transform the values to a range of -1 to 1, you would use the following formula:
    
    Scaled Value = -1 + 2 * (Value - Min) / (Max - Min)
    
    For the given dataset:
    - Min = 1
    - Max = 201
    
    Applying the formula for each value:
    
    Scaled Values:
    - 1: -1 + 2 * (1 - 1) / (201 - 1) = -1
    - 5: -1 + 2 * (5 - 1) / (201 - 1) = -0.94
    - 10: -1 + 2 * (10 - 1) / (201 - 1) = -0.87
    - 15: -1 + 2 * (15 - 1) / (201 - 1) = -0.80
    - 201: -1 + 2 * (201 - 1) / (201 - 1) = 1

**Q8. For a dataset containing the following features: [height, weight, age, gender, blood pressure], perform Feature Extraction using PCA. 
How many principal components would you choose to retain, and why?**

Ans:

    The number of principal components to retain would depend on the specific requirements of your analysis and the 
    amount of variance you want to preserve. You could use techniques like explained variance ratio to determine the 
    number of components that capture a high percentage of the total variance in the data. 
    
    For the given features, let's assume you computed that retaining 95% of the variance is sufficient.
    You would then perform PCA and select the number of components that accumulates at least 95% of the explained variance.
    The reason for retaining a high percentage of variance is to ensure that you retain the most important information while 
    reducing the dimensionality of the data.
    
The actual number of principal components to retain would need to be calculated based on your data and analysis goals.
