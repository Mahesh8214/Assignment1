Q1: Explain the following with an example:
1. Artificial Intelligence (AI):
   - AI is the simulation of human intelligence in machines that can perform tasks typically requiring human intelligence, 
              such as learning, reasoning, problem-solving, and decision-making.
   - Example: A virtual assistant like Siri or Alexa that can understand natural language, answer questions, 
              and perform tasks based on user commands.

2. Machine Learning (ML):
   - ML is a subset of AI that focuses on creating algorithms that allow computers to learn from data and
              improve their performance without being explicitly programmed.
   - Example: An email spam filter that learns to classify emails as "spam" or "not spam" based on historical data.

3. Deep Learning (DL):
   - DL is a subfield of ML that uses artificial neural networks to model and solve complex problems by learning 
              patterns from large amounts of data.
   - Example: Image recognition systems, like those used in self-driving cars, that can identify objects and make
              decisions based on visual input.

Q2: What is supervised learning? List some examples of supervised learning.
   - Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where the algorithm learns from labeled training data to
      make predictions or decisions.
   - Examples:
     a) Image classification: Identifying whether an image contains a cat or a dog.
     b) Sentiment analysis: Determining whether a movie review is positive or negative.
     c) Regression: Predicting the price of a house based on features like size and location.

Q3: What is unsupervised learning? List some examples of unsupervised learning.
   - Unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning where the algorithm learns from unlabeled data without explicit guidance.
   - Examples:
     a) Clustering: Grouping customers based on their purchasing behavior.
     b) Anomaly detection: Identifying unusual patterns in credit card transactions to detect fraud.
     c) Dimensionality reduction: Reducing the number of variables while preserving meaningful information.

Q4: What is the difference between AI, ML, DL, and DS?
   - AI (Artificial Intelligence) is the broader concept of creating intelligent machines that can simulate human intelligence.
   - ML (Machine Learning) is a subset of AI and focuses on developing algorithms that allow computers to learn from data.
   - DL (Deep Learning) is a specialized subset of ML that uses neural networks to learn from vast amounts of data.
   - DS (Data Science) is a multidisciplinary field that involves extracting knowledge and insights from data using various techniques, including ML and AI.

Q5: What are the main differences between supervised, unsupervised, and semi-supervised learning?
   - Supervised Learning: Uses labeled data for training and involves predicting outcomes or making decisions.
   - Unsupervised Learning: Uses unlabeled data for training and focuses on finding patterns or structures in the data.
   - Semi-Supervised Learning: Utilizes a combination of labeled and unlabeled data for training, which can be useful 
     when acquiring labeled data is costly or time-consuming.

Q6: What is train, test, and validation split? Explain the importance of each term.
   - Train, test, and validation split is a common practice in machine learning to evaluate model performance.
   - Train set: The portion of data used to train the model, allowing it to learn patterns and relationships.
   - Test set: The separate portion of data used to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data.
   - Validation set: An optional subset of the training data used to fine-tune hyperparameters and avoid overfitting.
   - Importance: Splitting data helps assess how well a model generalizes to new data, preventing overfitting, and provides insights into the model's performance.

Q7: How can unsupervised learning be used in anomaly detection?
   - Unsupervised learning can be used in anomaly detection by identifying unusual patterns or outliers in data without explicitly knowing what the anomalies are.
   - The algorithm learns the normal behavior of the system from unlabeled data and flags data instances that deviate significantly from the learned patterns as anomalies.
