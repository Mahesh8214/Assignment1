Q1: Define overfitting and underfitting in machine learning. What are the consequences of each, and how can they be mitigated?

- Overfitting: Overfitting occurs when a machine learning model learns too much from the training data and captures noise or
  random fluctuations instead of general patterns. As a result, the model performs well on the training data but poorly
  on unseen data (test data).
  Consequences: Reduced generalization, high variance, and poor performance on new data.

- Underfitting: Underfitting happens when a machine learning model is too simple to capture the underlying patterns 
  in the training data. It fails to learn important relationships, resulting in poor performance on both training and test data.
  Consequences: Poor accuracy, low complexity, and an inability to capture relevant patterns.

To mitigate overfitting and underfitting, the following strategies can be used:

- Overfitting mitigation:
  a) Use more training data to expose the model to a wider range of examples.
  b) Feature selection or engineering to reduce the complexity of the model.
  c) Cross-validation to tune hyperparameters and find the best model configuration.
  d) Regularization techniques to add penalties for complexity during training.

- Underfitting mitigation:
  a) Use more relevant features or improve data quality to increase the model's complexity.
  b) Select a more powerful model that can capture complex relationships.
  c) Adjust hyperparameters to allow the model to better fit the data.
  d) Perform more feature engineering to provide the model with more meaningful information.

Q2: How can we reduce overfitting? Explain in brief.

To reduce overfitting, you can employ the following techniques:

- Cross-validation: Split the data into multiple folds and use them for training and validation.
  This helps in selecting the best model and prevents overfitting.

- Regularization: Introduce penalties for complex models during training to discourage the model from overfitting the data.

- Data augmentation: Increase the size of the training dataset by applying transformations to existing data, 
  making the model generalize better.

- Early stopping: Monitor the model's performance during training and stop the process when it starts overfitting the training data.

Q3: Explain underfitting. List scenarios where underfitting can occur in ML.

Underfitting occurs when a machine learning model is too simplistic to capture the underlying patterns in the data.
It fails to learn the relationships between the input features and the target variable, leading to poor performance on
both training and test data.

Scenarios where underfitting can occur:
- Using a linear model to fit a nonlinear relationship between features and target.
- Using very few features to train a complex problem.
- Training a model with insufficient training data.
- Setting overly strict regularization penalties, leading to an excessively simple model.

Q4: Explain the bias-variance tradeoff in machine learning. What is the relationship between bias and variance, and 
    how do they affect model performance?

The bias-variance tradeoff is a fundamental concept in machine learning that deals with finding the right balance between bias and variance in a model.

- Bias: Bias refers to the error introduced by approximating a real-world problem with a simplified model. High bias models tend to underfit, 
        as they oversimplify the data.

- Variance: Variance refers to the model's sensitivity to the fluctuations in the training data. High variance models tend to overfit, 
            as they capture noise and perform well on the training data but poorly on unseen data.

The relationship between bias and variance is inversely proportional. As you decrease bias, variance increases, and vice versa. 
The challenge is to strike a balance to achieve the best generalization on unseen data.

Q5: Discuss some common methods for detecting overfitting and underfitting in machine learning models. 
    How can you determine whether your model is overfitting or underfitting?

- Methods for detecting overfitting:
  a) Hold-out validation: Split the data into training and validation sets. If the model performs significantly better
     on the training data than the validation data, it may be overfitting.
  b) Learning curves: Plot the model's performance on both training and validation data against the number of training samples.
     Overfitting is indicated by a significant performance gap between the two curves.
  c) Cross-validation: Repeatedly train and validate the model on different subsets of the data. If performance varies widely, 
     the model may be overfitting.

- Methods for detecting underfitting:
  a) Similar approaches to overfitting detection can be used. If the model performs poorly on both the training and validation data, 
     it may be underfitting.
  b) Learning curves can also help identify underfitting. If both training and validation performance plateau at a low level, 
     the model is likely underfitting.

Q6: Compare and contrast bias and variance in machine learning. What are some examples of high bias and high variance models, 
    and how do they differ in terms of their performance?

- High Bias:
  - Underfitting occurs due to high bias.
  - The model is too simplistic and fails to capture the underlying patterns in the data.
  - It performs poorly on both the training and test data.
  - Examples: Linear regression on a nonlinear problem, single decision tree on a complex dataset.

- High Variance:
  - Overfitting occurs due to high variance.
  - The model is overly complex and captures noise or random fluctuations in the training data.
  - It performs well on the training data but poorly on new, unseen data.
  - Examples: Deep neural networks with excessive layers on a small dataset, high-degree polynomial regression on limited data.

Q7: What is regularization in machine learning, and how can it be used to prevent overfitting? 
    Describe some common regularization techniques and how they work.

- Regularization is a technique used to prevent overfitting in machine learning models by adding penalty terms for model complexity during training.

Common regularization techniques include:

1. L1 Regularization (Lasso):
   - Adds the absolute value of the model's coefficients as a penalty term.
   - Encourages sparsity and sets some coefficients to exactly zero.
   - Helps with feature selection.

2. L2 Regularization (Ridge):
   - Adds the squared value of the model's coefficients as a penalty term.
   - Encourages small but non-zero coefficients.
   - Helps reduce the impact of less relevant features.

3. Dropout (for neural networks):
   - Randomly deactivates a fraction of neurons during each training iteration.
   - Prevents co-adaptation of neurons and improves generalization.

4. Elastic Net:
   - Combines L1 and L2 regularization to leverage their respective benefits.
   - Helps to address the limitations of L1 and L2 regularization individually.

Regularization helps prevent overfitting by discouraging the model from fitting noise in the training data and 
promoting a simpler model with better generalization capabilities.
