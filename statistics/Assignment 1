Q1. What is the Probability density function?
Ans: The PDF is used to describe the probability distribution of a continuous random variable.
     It tells us the relative likelihood of observing different values or ranges of values for the variable.
     The PDF is represented by a function, denoted as f(x), where x is the variable.
     The function assigns probabilities to different outcomes within the range of the variable.
     The PDF is always non-negative, meaning it cannot have negative probabilities

-> Log-Normal Distribution

Ans:

Q4. What are the properties of Binomial distribution? Give two examples of events where binomial
distribution can be applied.
Ans:

The Binomial distribution has several properties that make it a valuable tool in probability and statistics. 
The properties of the Binomial distribution are as follows:

Fixed Number of Trials: The Binomial distribution models a fixed number, denoted as n, of independent and
                        identical trials or experiments.
Two Possible Outcomes: Each trial in the Binomial distribution can have only two possible outcomes, 
                        often referred to as success (S) and failure (F).
Constant Probability: The probability of success, denoted as p, remains constant for each trial.
                      Similarly, the probability of failure, denoted as q = 1 - p, also remains constant.
Independence: The trials or experiments in the Binomial distribution are assumed to be independent of each other.
              The outcome of one trial does not affect the outcomes of other trials.
Counting Successes: The Binomial distribution focuses on counting the number of successes, denoted as X,
                    that occur in the fixed number of trials (n).
Probability Mass Function: The probability mass function (PMF) of the Binomial distribution gives the 
                           probability of obtaining a specific number of successes in the given number of trials.

Q5. Generate a random sample of size 1000 from a binomial distribution with probability of success 0.4
and plot a histogram of the results using matplotlib.
Ans:
      import numpy as np
      import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
      n = 1000  # Sample size
      p = 0.4  # Probability of success
      
      # Generate random binomial sample 
      sample = np.random.binomial(n, p, size=n)
      
      # Plot histogram
      plt.hist(sample, bins=20, edgecolor='black')
      plt.xlabel('Number of Successes')
      plt.ylabel('Frequency')
      plt.title('Histogram of Binomial Distribution')
      plt.show()

Q6. Write a Python function to calculate the cumulative distribution function of a Poisson distribution

    def calculate_poisson_cdf(k, mean):
        cdf = 0.0
        for i in range(k + 1):
            cdf += math.exp(-mean) * (mean ** i) / math.factorial(i)
        return cdf

Q7. How Binomial distribution different from Poisson distribution?
Ans:

Nature of Events:
Binomial Distribution: The Binomial distribution models a fixed number of independent and identical trials or experiments, where each trial has two possible outcomes (success or failure).
Poisson Distribution: The Poisson distribution models the number of events occurring within a fixed interval of time or space, where events happen randomly and independently.
Number of Outcomes:

Binomial Distribution: The Binomial distribution has two possible outcomes for each trial (success or failure).
Poisson Distribution: The Poisson distribution is a discrete distribution that represents the number of occurrences of an event in a given interval. The number of events can range from 0 to infinity.

Probability Parameters:
Binomial Distribution: The Binomial distribution has two parameters: the number of trials (n) and the probability of success in each trial (p).
Poisson Distribution: The Poisson distribution has one parameter: the average rate or mean number of events (Î») occurring in the given interval.

Assumptions:
Binomial Distribution: The Binomial distribution assumes a fixed number of trials, independence between trials, constant probability of success, and a binary outcome for each trial.
Poisson Distribution: The Poisson distribution assumes events occur randomly and independently within a fixed interval, with the average rate of occurrence remaining constant.

Applications:
Binomial Distribution: The Binomial distribution is commonly used to model events with a fixed number of trials and two possible outcomes, such as coin flips, pass/fail rates, or success/failure experiments.
Poisson Distribution: The Poisson distribution is often used to model the occurrence of rare events over a fixed interval, such as the number of calls received at a call center within a specific time frame, the number of accidents in a day

Q8. Generate a random sample of size 1000 from a Poisson distribution with mean 5 and calculate the
sample mean and variance.
Ans:

    import numpy as np
    sample_size = 1000
    mean = 5
    
    sample = np.random.poisson(mean, size=sample_size)
    
    # Calculate sample mean and variance
    sample_mean = np.mean(sample)
    sample_variance = np.var(sample)
    
    # Print the results
    print("Sample Mean:", sample_mean)
    print("Sample Variance:", sample_variance)
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Q9. How mean and variance are related in Binomial distribution and Poisson distribution?
Ans:
    In the Binomial distribution, the variance depends on both the number of trials and 
    the probability of success, while in the Poisson distribution, the variance is solely determined by the mean value
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Q10. In normal distribution with respect to mean position, where does the least frequent data appear?
Ans:
  The normal distribution is symmetric, with the mean located at the center of the distribution. 
  The tails of the distribution extend infinitely in both directions. The data points in the tails are 
  less frequent because they represent extreme values that are farther away from the mean.
