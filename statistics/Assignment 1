QI. What is Statistics?
Ans: 
    Statistics is a branch of mathematics that involves collecting, organizing, analyzing, interpreting,
    and presenting data. It provides methods and techniques for making sense of numerical information
    to draw conclusions, make predictions, and support decision-making in various fields, such as science,
    economics, social sciences, and more.

Q2. Define the different types of statistics and give an example of when each type might be used.
Ans:
-> The two main types of statistics: descriptive statistics and inferential statistics.

    1. Descriptive Statistics: These methods are used to summarize and describe data without drawing any
    conclusions beyond the data itself. Examples include mean, median, mode, range, and standard deviation.
    For instance, calculating the average (mean) age of students in a class is a descriptive statistic.
    
    2. Inferential Statistics: These methods involve making inferences or predictions about a larger
    population based on a sample of data. Examples include hypothesis testing, regression analysis, 
    and confidence intervals. For instance, determining whether a new drug has a significant effect 
    on reducing blood pressure using a sample of patients is an inferential statistic.

Q3. What are the different types of data and how do they differ from each other? Provide an example of
each type of data.
Ans: 
->There are two main types of data: quantitative data and qualitative data.

    1. Quantitative Data: This type of data consists of numerical measurements or quantities that 
    can be subjected to mathematical operations. Examples include heights, ages, temperatures, and test scores.
    
    2. Qualitative Data: Also known as categorical data, this type of data represents categories or labels 
    and cannot be measured with numerical values. Examples include gender, color, type of fruit, and 
    educational level.

Q4. Categorise the following datasets with respect to quantitative and qualitative data types:
(i) Grading in exam: A+, A, B+, B, C+, C, D, E
(ii) Colour of mangoes: yellow, green, orange, red
(iii) Height data of a class: [178.9, 179, 179.5, 176, 177.2, 178.3, 175.8,...1
(iv) Number of mangoes exported by a farm: [500, 600, 478, 672. ...l
Ans: 
    (i) Grading in exam: Qualitative (ordinal) data.
    (ii) Colour of mangoes: Qualitative (nominal) data.
    (iii) Height data of a class: Quantitative (continuous) data.
    (iv) Number of mangoes exported by a farm: Quantitative (discrete) data.

Q5. Explain the concept of levels of measurement and give an example of a variable for each level.
Ans: 
    There are four levels of measurement: nominal, ordinal, interval, and ratio.

    1. Nominal: Categories with no inherent order, like gender or colors.
    2. Ordinal: Categories with a meaningful order but no consistent differences between values,
                like rating scales (e.g., satisfaction levels: "Very Satisfied," "Satisfied," "Neutral," etc.).
    3. Interval: Ordered categories with consistent differences between values but no true zero point,
                 like temperature in Celsius or Fahrenheit.
    4. Ratio: Ordered categories with consistent differences and a meaningful zero point, like height,
               weight, and income

Q6. Why is it important to understand the level of measurement when analyzing data? Provide an
example to illustrate your answer.
Ans: 
    Understanding levels of measurement is important because it determines the appropriate statistical
    methods that can be applied to the data. Using the wrong method can lead to incorrect conclusions.
    For example, calculating the average of temperature in Celsius (interval data) and interpreting it 
    as having twice the magnitude as another temperature is not valid due to the absence of a true 
    zero point.

Q7. How nominal data type is different from ordinal data type.
Ans: 
    Nominal data represents categories with no inherent order, while ordinal data represents 
    categories with a meaningful order. In nominal data, the categories are distinct and cannot
    be ranked, whereas in ordinal data, the categories can be ranked but the differences between
    ranks may not be uniform or meaningful.

Q8. Which type of plot can be used to display data in terms of range?
Ans: 
    A box plot (box-and-whisker plot) is commonly used to display the range of a dataset,
    showing the minimum, first quartile, median, third quartile, and maximum values.
    It provides a visual representation of the spread and central tendency of the data.

Q9. Describe the difference between descriptive and inferential statistics. Give an example of each
type of statistics and explain how they are used.
Ans: 
   1. Descriptive Statistics: These summarize and describe data, providing insights into its 
    characteristics. For example, calculating the average income of a group describes their earning patterns.

   2. Inferential Statistics: These involve drawing conclusions about a larger population based on 
    a sample. For instance, using inferential statistics, you might determine whether a new marketing 
    strategy will be effective for a whole target audience based on its effectiveness with a smaller sample.

QIO. What are some common measures of central tendency and variability used in statistics? Explain
how each measure can be used to describe a dataset.
Ans:
   Central Tendency: These measures describe the center of a dataset.

        Mean: The average of all values.
        Median: The middle value when data is arranged in order.
        Mode: The most frequently occurring value.
        Variability: These measures describe the spread or dispersion of data.
        
        Range: The difference between the maximum and minimum values.
        Variance: The average of squared deviations from the mean.
        Standard Deviation: The square root of the variance, indicating average deviation from the mean.
