Q1. What is an API? Give an example, where an API is used in real life.
Ans:
    An API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of protocols, routines, and tools for building software applications. 
    It specifies how software components should interact with each other, allowing different applications to communicate and share data.
    APIs are used in real life to enable communication between different software systems, such as social media platforms,
    mobile apps, and web applications. 
    For example, the Facebook API allows developers to access Facebook's data and functionality to build apps that integrate with Facebook

Q2. Give advantages and disadvantages of using API.
Ans:
      Advantages of using API:
          Improved efficiency and productivity by enabling reuse of existing code and functionality
          Increased flexibility and scalability by allowing different applications to communicate and share data
          Improved user experience by enabling integration with other applications and services
          Reduced development time and cost by providing pre-built components and functionality
          Increased innovation by enabling developers to build new applications and services on top of existing platforms
      Disadvantages of using API:
          Security risks, such as unauthorized access to data and functionality
          Compatibility issues between different versions of the API and different software systems
          Dependency on the API provider, which can limit flexibility and control
          Complexity and learning curve associated with using APIs
          Potential for performance issues and downtime due to high usage or changes to the API

Q3. What is a Web API? Differentiate between API and Web API.
Ans:
      A Web API is an API that is accessed over the web using HTTP protocols. It is a type of API that is designed to be used by web applications and services, 
      and it typically uses standard web technologies such as XML, JSON, and REST.
      The main difference between API and Web API is that API is a general term that refers to any set of protocols,
      routines, and tools for building software applications, while Web API specifically refers to APIs that are accessed over the web using HTTP protocols.

Q4. Explain REST and SOAP Architecture. Mention shortcomings of SOAP.
Ans:
    REST (Representational State Transfer) is an architectural style for building web services that uses HTTP protocols to access and manipulate resources.
    It is a lightweight and flexible architecture that is designed to be scalable and easy to use.
    RESTful APIs use standard HTTP methods such as GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE to perform operations on resources, and they typically use JSON or XML for data exchange.
    SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) is a messaging protocol for exchanging structured information between web services.
    It uses XML for data exchange and provides a standardized way of communicating between different software systems. SOAP APIs use a set of rules and protocols for exchanging messages between different software systems, and they typically use XML for data exchange

Q5. Differentiate between REST and SOAP.
Ans:
    REST is an architectural style for building web services that uses HTTP protocols to access and manipulate resources, while SOAP is a messaging protocol for exchanging structured information between web services.
    RESTful APIs use standard HTTP methods such as GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE to perform operations on resources, while SOAP APIs use a set of rules and protocols for exchanging messages between different software systems.
    RESTful APIs are lightweight and flexible, while SOAP APIs are more complex and heavyweight.
    RESTful APIs use JSON or XML for data exchange, while SOAP APIs use XML for data exchange.
    RESTful APIs are more scalable and efficient than SOAP APIs, while SOAP APIs are more tightly coupled and less flexible than RESTful APIs
